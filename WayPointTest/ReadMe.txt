Brief explanation:

There are prefabs of all assets created in the Waypoint scene. Create a traffic system by dragging
and dropping the environmental assets, using the waypoint prefab to create a trail for a padestrian or a vehicle character.
All prefabs have the necessary scripts attached to them.

In this Project there are two scenes, Welcome & WaypointTest.

Play the build and enjoy the scenic little city.
